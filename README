kloader

* made by winocm and improved by axi0mX
* armv7 support for iOS 4.0-9.3.5 (requires a jailbreak with tfp0 kernel patch)
* arm64 support for iOS 7.0-8.4.1 (requires a jailbreak with tfp0 kernel patch and patched LLB/iBoot/iBSS/iBEC)
* will automatically wake up device after 2 seconds (no button press required, should work 99.9% of the time)
* does not need to be compiled! just use the provided armv7+arm64 binary in bin/kloader

Please report issues and I will do my best to fix them.
